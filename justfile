# lean-lattices — Lean libraries for lattice mathematics and categorical foundations.
#
# Lake owns compilation and Mathlib supplies the dependency cache. Language-level
# QC law is delegated to the global gate (~/ai-review-ci/justfiles/lean.just);
# this file keeps only build entry points, the repo-supplied kernel-axiom audit,
# and the repo's additive convention layer.
#
# Not yet wired: the global lean-semgrep gate (Lean referent tripwires). It is
# adopted the moment the legacy tree's axiom/shim debt is burned down by work
# units #30–#40 — flipping it on earlier would red-gate main on known, owned
# debt. Do not add suppressions to adopt it sooner.
